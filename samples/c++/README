Running the sample
******************
The C++ sample code shows the use of the p3recastnavigation module.
The C++ samples uses the autotools build system, so could be surely
built on GNU/Linux using these commands within the "c++" folder:

  autoreconf -i -v -W no-all
  ./configure
  make
  
and executed with:

  ./main
  
or

  ./test
  
However the code (main.cpp) should also compile successfully on other 
platforms (after suitably creating/modifying the "main.h" file that defines 
the global string variable "dataDir", i.e. the path to models' data).

Note: it should pointed out that the style and structure of sample programs' 
code is not really favored by the author, but it is solely intended to test 
and show functionality exposed by the p3recastnavigation module.
