Running the sample
******************
The python code shows the use of the p3recastnavigation module.
To run the python samples you should copy the module (p3recastnavigation) 
into the "pyhton" folder, and run the command:

 python main.py

or

 python test.py

Note: it should pointed out that the style and structure of sample program's 
code is not really favored by the author, but it is solely intended to test 
and show functionality exposed by the p3recastnavigation module.
